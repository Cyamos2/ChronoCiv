HOW TO RUN
==========

1. Open the project in Unity (2021.3+ recommended)

2. Set up the project:
   - Import all PNG sprites from Data/Art/Sprites
   - Set texture type to "Sprite (2D and UI)"
   - Pixels per unit: 16 for NPCs, 32 for buildings

3. Create scenes:
   - MainMenu.scene - Title screen
   - Game.scene - Main gameplay scene

4. Add prefabs:
   - NPC prefab with SpriteAnimator component
   - Building prefabs
   - UI canvas with GameUI prefab

5. Press Play to start!

GENERATING SPRITES
==================

To generate pixel art sprites:
```bash
cd /Users/christopheramos/Projects/ChronoCiv
python3 Tools/generate_sprites.py --output Data/Art/Sprites
```

Requires: pip install pillow

SPRITE SPECIFICATIONS
====================

NPC Sprites: 16x24 pixels (with directional variations)
Building Sprites: 32x32 pixels (variable heights)
Terrain Tiles: 16x16 pixels
UI Icons: 16x16 pixels
Animation: 8 FPS for idle, 12 FPS for movement

COLOR PALETTE
=============

Each era has a unique color palette:
- Stone Age: Earthy browns and greens
- Ancient: Warm golds and terracottas
- Classical: Whites, creams, and marble
- Medieval: Rich reds, purples, and dark colors
- Renaissance: Deep jewel tones
- Industrial: Grays and steely blues
- Modern: Diverse contemporary colors
- Future: Neon and holographic colors

CUSTOMIZATION
=============

To modify game balance:
- Edit Data/eras.json for era timing
- Edit Data/buildings.json for costs and production
- Edit Data/resources.json for resource values
- Edit Data/tech_tree.json for technology requirements

To add new content:
- Add entries to appropriate JSON files
- Create new sprite images
- Update NPC profiles for new archetypes

KNOWN ISSUES
============

- Sprite generation requires Pillow library
- Some UI elements may need adjustment
- Performance may vary with large NPC counts

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
===================

- Multiplayer support
- More biomes and terrain types
- Unit combat system
- Trade routes
- Diplomacy with other civilizations
- Achievements and statistics
- Sound effects and music
- Video cutscenes for era transitions
